        <h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
        <p>If you hadn't guessed it by now, my name is Braden, I'm a Dirtbag Climber, and Photographer, living in the beautiful Appalachian Mountains!  For the past few years, I’ve been climbing as often as I can, and I recently picked up a camera to capture the moments I consider myself lucky to experience.  I graduated from Western Carolina University in May, with a Bachelor’s in Parks and Recreation Management, and since then, I’ve been teaching myself the ins and outs of photography through pure obsession, and the process of experiential education!   It certainly helps that I am never at a loss of moments worthy of photographing.  I’m constantly climbing something, or otherwise mucking around in the outdoors, and I’m lucky to be surrounded by an incredible community that gives the moments their meaning!  </p>

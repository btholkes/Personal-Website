        <h3><strong>Who am I?</strong></h3>
        <p>If you couldn't guess this already, my name is Braden Tholkes.  I am a Parks and Recreation Management major at Western Carolina University. I am focusing my studies around Outdoor Leadership and Instruction, because I hope to be a climbing guide or NOLS/Outward Bound instructor.  My life goal is to get as many people reconnected with nature as I can!  My biggest passion is climbing, but I adore any activity that gets me outside, and welcome any chance to have new experiences in new areas.  I started my college career as a Computer Science major, and studied the art of wasting away infront of a screen for two years before rediscovering my childhood passion for the outdoors.  I firmly believe the outdoors is where I belong, and I am happier than I have ever been climbing every weekend, and studying classes that prepare me for stoking the passions of others for the outdoors.</p>

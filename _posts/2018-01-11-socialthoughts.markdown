For most of my life, I have been plagued by social anxiety.  Luckily, however, I have been graced with the ability to overcome it's influence.  With the help of finding the right meds, and seeking my passions for the outdoors, I have finally been able to shake my demons.  However, there are still specks of anxiety that remain.  I am able to talk to people, and interact within social environments without being panic stricken, but I still find myself seeking the approval of those around me.  This is a human trait everybody possesses to some extent, but my great fear is that I worry too much about being granted acceptance, and my reasons for doing things are flawed.  

We live in a strange age where the norm is to post about every aspect of your personal life and soak in the likes, comments, and glory.  While it swells your ego temporarily, it seems to me it creates more harm than it's worth.  The satisfaction from getting 34 likes on a selfie is worth a lot of temporary happiness, but through time it is then not enough.  Soon enough 34 likes isn't enough to give you satisfaction.  Soon enough it just becomes another stressor.

While I have no scientific evidence, nor the will to research this topic, I believe this is a big reason as to why almost everybody you talk to is depressed or anxious.  In our social age, the natural need for acceptance and to be noticed is pushed to higher and higher limits as we are desensitized to it's effects.  While this may not be true for everybody, I have found this is definitely true for me.

Recently, I broke up with my girlfriend of almost two years, and the sudden shock of feeling utterly alone in the world hit me like a train.  To compensate, I have tried to begin posting to social media a lot more under the secret pretense that I was trying to find joy through making others happy.  As pretenses normally go, this reasoning was falsified; I was seaking personal satisfaction.  I was hoping to fill the void of being thrust back into the life of a single man by soaking in virtual tokens of human acceptance.

Now here is where I find the most issues, and where I begin to fall back into a mindset run by anxiety.  Is it truly unhealthy to want to be accepted in this manner?  Similarly, situations like this make me question my morals; I begin to question whether I wish to be viewed as a "kind" person to fill my ego, or if I truly wish to improve other's lives.  Then again, is there a difference?
